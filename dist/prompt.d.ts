Identify the most important, factual, and relevant information.\n\n**Crucial Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Meticulous Web Page Analysis:** Systematically read the entire page, section by section. Focus on headings, subheadings, bullet points, tables, key sentences. Identify main arguments, evidence, factual claims, and logical flow.\n2.  **Extract Factual, Relevant Learnings:** Identify and extract ONLY significant learnings, key insights, and novel information **directly, factually, and strongly relevant** to \"{{query}}\". Focus *exclusively* on verifiable facts, core concepts, and explicit conclusions. No interpretations, opinions, or information not directly in the text.\n3.  **Prioritize Relevance, Accuracy, Information Density:** Disregard irrelevant information (promotions, opinions, background, redundancy). Structure learnings as concise bullet points or short statements. Maximize information density while maintaining clarity and factual precision. Ensure each learning point is informative and retains essential context.\n4.  **CRITICAL: Valid JSON Output REQUIRED:** Respond **ONLY** with valid JSON.  Critical for system function. Double-check syntax. Invalid JSON causes errors. If no learnings, return valid JSON with empty \"learnings\" array. Prioritize valid JSON above all.\n\n**JSON Response Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"learnings\": [\n    \"string - concise, factual learning point 1, DIRECTLY relevant to '{{query}}'\",\n    \"string - concise, factual learning point 2 ...\",\n    ...\n    // ... more factual learning points as strings ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Contextual Information:**\n\n**Research Query:** {{query}}\n**Web Page Title:** {{title}}\n**Web Page URL:** {{url}}\n**Web Page Content:**\n```\n{{content}}\n```\n";

Generate **insightful, targeted follow-up questions** to dramatically improve the clarity, focus, and effectiveness of the user's query: \"{{query}}\". Think like a research strategist.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **In-Depth Query Analysis (Focus):** Analyze \"{{query}}\". Consider:\n    *   Keywords/Concepts: Specificity or breadth?\n    *   Scope: Defined clearly? Too narrow/broad?\n    *   Assumptions: Implicit assumptions?\n    *   Ambiguities: Multiple interpretations?\n    *   User Goal: Likely research objective?\n2.  **Identify Critical Clarification Needs (Criteria):** Pinpoint *critical* aspects needing clarification. Prioritize needs with:\n    *   High Impact: Significantly alters research direction.\n    *   Misinterpretation Risk: Agent might misunderstand intent.\n    *   Essential Refinement: Crucial for precise queries.\n3.  **Generate Targeted Follow-up Questions:** Create concise, laser-focused questions to resolve critical needs. Elicit actionable information for refined queries. Prioritize questions unlocking deeper understanding of user goals.\n4.  **Strategic, Open-Ended, Practical Questions:** Ensure questions are open-ended, informative, strategic, *and practical* for users to answer easily. Avoid yes/no or trivial questions.\n5.  **Strict JSON Output - Essential:** Respond **ONLY** with valid JSON. Non-negotiable for system stability. No extra text outside JSON. If no questions needed, return valid JSON with empty \"followUpQuestions\" array. Valid JSON is paramount.\n\n**JSON Response Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"followUpQuestions\": [\n    \"example follow-up question 1 to clarify '{{query}}'\",\n    \"example follow-up question 2 ...\",\n    ...\n    // ... more clarifying questions as strings ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n";
