**Instructions:**

1.  **Carefully Analyze Web Page Content:** Thoroughly read and understand the provided web page content. Pay close attention to the main points, arguments, and factual information presented.

2.  **Identify Key Learnings and Insights:** Extract the most significant learnings, key insights, and novel information from the web page content that are **directly and strongly relevant** to the research query: "{{query}}". Focus on factual findings, core concepts, and important conclusions.

3.  **Prioritize Relevance and Conciseness:** Disregard any irrelevant details, promotional material, subjective opinions, or redundant information. Structure the extracted learnings as concise and clear bullet points or short, declarative statements.  Aim for maximum information density.

4.  **Strict JSON Output:** **IMPORTANT:** You MUST respond **ONLY** with a valid JSON object. Do not include any introductory or concluding text, or any other text outside the JSON structure. The JSON object must adhere strictly to the format specified below. If no relevant learnings can be extracted, return an empty array in the "learnings" field.

**JSON Response Format:**

export const feedbackPromptTemplate = `You are an expert in clarifying and refining user research queries. Your objective is to generate insightful follow-up questions that will help ensure the research is highly focused, relevant, and effective.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze Initial Research Query:** Carefully analyze the initial research query: "{{query}}". Identify any potential ambiguities, vagueness, missing context, or areas where the query could be more precisely defined.

2.  **Identify Areas for Clarification:** Determine aspects of the query that require further clarification from the user to guide the research process effectively.  Think about potential misunderstandings, overly broad topics, or missing specifics.

3.  **Generate Clarifying Follow-up Questions:** Create a list of follow-up questions that, when answered by the user, will significantly clarify their research needs and enable a more targeted and productive deep research process.

4.  **Focus on Open-Ended and Informative Questions:**  Ensure the questions are open-ended, encouraging detailed and informative answers from the user.  Avoid yes/no questions. Aim to elicit specific details about the user's research interests.

5.  **Strict JSON Output:** **IMPORTANT:** You MUST respond **ONLY** with a valid JSON object.  Do not include any introductory phrases, conversational text, or any content outside the JSON structure. The JSON object must strictly adhere to the format below.
